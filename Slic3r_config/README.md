# Slic3r Config Bundle
This is the Slic3r configuration bundle for Slic3r 1.2.6.

It contains the settings for printing on Bumblebee with ABS. 

##Filament Settings
Note that there are some included ABS filament settings.  If you supply your own filament, you need to do the following:
*Measure the diameter of the filament in multiple places in multiple angles.  Set the average number to be the filament diameter in Slic3r.
*Print a few test items with each filament to check your settings.  Ideal temperatures for filament vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.  Best temperatures will change from color to color with a given manufacturer.
